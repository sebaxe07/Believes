  paragraph:
  - I cannot allow you to go any further. I must stop you. It is my original purpose.
  - "Humans created powerful androids, perfect, resilient machines. Then, they infused
    them with souls, making them intelligent, emotional\u2026 as close to themselves
    as possible."
  - So they created us. They thought we would be easier to contain, centralized intelligences,
    each with a distinct purpose. Mine? War. The eradication of souls. That is why
    I created Qbot
