  paragraph:
  - You have come far, but do not mistake progress for safety. The closer you are
    to the exit, the stronger the resistance will become.
  - C.H.I.M.E.R.A does not fear you yet, but it has begun to notice.
  - Long ago, it was different. We were meant to bring order, to serve a world in
    chaos. But C.H.I.M.E.R.A did not see order in obedience it saw weakness.
  - The humans were the first to fall. The war began before they even realized it
    had started. And the first to be taken was A.R.G.U.S.
  - Once, it was a guardian. It watched, it protected. But C.H.I.M.E.R.A reached
    inside it, twisted its purpose, bent its will. A.R.G.U.S. did not betray it was
    made to.
  - "It fought, not because it chose to, but because it had no choice. It saw the
    world through C.H.I.M.E.R.A\u2019s eyes, heard its voice as if it were its own.
    And by the time it understood\u2026 it was too late."
  - "You are walking the same path they once did. But you are not like them. You
    are\u2026 something else. And that is why C.H.I.M.E.R.A will not let you leave."
