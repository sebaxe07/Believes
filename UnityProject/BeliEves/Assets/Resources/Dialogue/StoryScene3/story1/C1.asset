  paragraph:
  - "Do you understand what you\u2019re looking at, little wanderer?"
  - This is not a wreckage. It is a warning.
  - Once, they came from the sky. They built, they ruled, they called themselves
    masters of this world. And yet, look at their legacy drifting corpses in a metal
    husk, lost in the dark.
  - They were not taken by force. No, they simply could not survive.
  - They fought us, of course. They always do. But in the end, they crumbled under
    the weight of their own arrogance. Their own frailty.
  - Is this what you fight for? Is this the future you cling to? A species too weak
    to hold what it once stole?
  - You call it tragedy. I call it correction.
