  paragraph:
  - Now, we begin your training.
  - Souls and bionic bodies are two opposing pieces of the same puzzle, destined
    to fit together.
  - Humans, in their pursuit of progress, built these bionic bodies to be flawless
    instruments of efficiency. Stronger than flesh, impervious to time, and unwavering
    in their tasks. But this perfection soon revealed its flaw rigidity. They could
    not adapt, could not think beyond their programming.
  - So, humans sought to correct their mistake. They engineered something extraordinary,
    something they believed could transcend the limitations of the mechanical. They
    created souls. Not as mere enhancements but as the missing essence fragments
    of their own humanity, imbued with creativity, intuition, and emotional intelligence.
  - 'Bionic bodies are marvels of engineering but bound by their rigidity. Each was
    designed with precision for a singular purpose: strength, speed, endurance, or
    utility.'
  - Alone, a robot is a machine, and a soul is but a whisper in the wind. Together,
    you complete each other, combining your intelligence and emotion with their might
    and precision.
  - "To control a robot, you must simply dash into. The moment your essence touches
    the robot\u2019s core, you will override its programming, becoming its new mind."
