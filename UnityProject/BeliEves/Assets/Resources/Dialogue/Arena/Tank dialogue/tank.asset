  paragraph:
  - "Eve, this is the Tank a machine built for one purpose: strength. Unlike the
    more agile or specialized robots, the Tank is designed to withstand damage and
    deliver devastating power. Whether you\u2019re engaging in combat or moving heavy
    objects, this unit is your go-to for sheer brute force."
  - Its robust frame allows it to break through barriers with a single strike, the
    Tank can shatter walls and create paths where none exist.
