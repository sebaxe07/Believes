  - Welcome Eve... Inside your new body, your new self ... your temporary self.
  - This particular unit is the Support robot. Unlike the more aggressive models,
    the Support is engineered for resilience and maintenance. Its design incorporates
    advanced self-repair mechanisms that allow it to heal itself.
  - 'Each robot has three abilities: light, heavy, and special. These can be used
    as attacks or to interact with the factory.'
  - But the Support's abilities extend beyond self-preservation. It possesses the
    capacity to repair objects in its immediate vicinity. Whether it's restoring
    damaged infrastructure, fixing malfunctioning machinery, or reinforcing weakened
    structures, the Support unit plays a crucial role in maintaining the factory's
    functionality.
  - You can press the special attack button to start healing and press it again to
    stop.
