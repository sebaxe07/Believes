  paragraph:
  - "There are moments when you will encounter robots that are under the control
    of C.H.I.M.E.R.A\u2019s influence. These robots, are essentially puppets, their
    minds twisted and enslaved by the AI\u2019s programming. You cannot simply take
    control of them as you would with a free unit."
  - "In these cases, the only way to gain control is through force. You must defeat
    these robots in combat, breaking through the mental hold C.H.I.M.E.R.A has on
    them. Once you\u2019ve incapacitated them, you will have the opportunity to reclaim
    their bodies as your own. The victory is not just physical but also a reclaiming
    of autonomy from the AI\u2019s grip.\r\n"
